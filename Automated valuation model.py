# ### Comments
#

# They have some speical characters like Dollar sign, comma etc that needs to be stripped.
# 
# After scrubbing, the descriptive statistics of numerical columns is as following,
# 
# Interpretations:
#  - there are missing values as the count are not same for all the columns, that might need imputing
#  - some of them are empty columns that needs to be dropped
#  - Due to large gaps in min and max values for columns like Total Living Area, Rooms etc. data might require normalisation for modelling purposes
#  - there are some irrelevant columns that are identifiers but not relevant for modelling like Roll number, Street number etc.

#  - As per correlation analysis, dropping column 'Current Assessment Year', 'GISD','Street number', 'Centroid Lon', 'Centroid Lat'.
#  - Features with a large number of unique categories can be challenging to handle in machine learning models, as they might lead to high-dimensional data.The columns with more than 500 categories may not contribute to AVM. Hence they can be dropped. 
#  - Also columns with 1 category were looked into manually in excel file. They were just singular value against a property record which would play no role in prediction modelling, so they are dropped.
#  - Columns like Assessed Value, status, Property Class 1, 2,3,4,5 were dropped as we have a condensed column displaying the same values.

# ### Checking for Data quality issues
# 
# - Total Living Area has maximum value as 11197 which significantly higher than 75th percentile indicating outliers. There can be records of properties that are large estates or multi-unit buildings. These large values can skew model training
# - The maximum date is 2025 that is the current year, some records may indicate future date, or data error. these records would need validation
# - Rooms has maximum value as 29 which might indicate mansions

# In[21]:


ds[['Total Living Area', 'Year Built', 'Rooms']].describe()


# ### Comments
# Histograms and Boxplots is used to further understand outliers and skewness in distribution for these features.
# 
# - **Total Living Area**
#     - Histogram:  The distribution is right skewed indicating most properties having living area between 500 to 2000 sq feet
#     - Box plot: The plot confirms peak of histogram and depicts outliers for Living area more than 2500 sq feet
#     The outliers can be capped at 99th percentile and with log transformation to normalise the distribution
# 
# - **Year Built**
#      - Histogram: this distribution is multimodal with distinct peaks early 1900, 1940 - 1960, 1980. Few builts before 1900 indicating outliers
#      - Box plot: The plot confirms outliers before 1900 which might have to handled
#     A derieved feature 'Age of Property' can be used instead to deal with outliers, and multimodal 
#      
# 
# - **Rooms**
#      - Histogram: The distribution is also right skewed indicating most properties has 5-10 rooms
#      - Box plot: The plot indicates outliers after 10 indicating few luxury properties
#     The outliers can be capped at 99th percentile

# ### One- Hot Encoding for Categorical columns
# 
# In order to process categorical columns in machine learning algorithms, the categorical columns has to be encoded to numerical columns.
# 
# - Low-Cardinality Categorical Columns (â¤ 20 unique values)
# These were one-hot encoded (converted into binary columns):
# 
#     - Market Region
#     - Building Type
#     - Basement
#     - Basement Finish
#     - Air Conditioning
#     - Fire Place
#     - Attached Garage
#     - Detached Garage
#     - Pool
#     - Property Use Code
# 
# - High-Cardinality Categorical Columns (> 20 unique values)
# These were frequency encoded (replaced with the count of each category's occurrence):
# 
#     - Street Type
#     - Neighbourhood Area
#     - Zoning

# In[30]:


# Drop unnamed index column if present
ds = ds.loc[:, ~ds.columns.str.contains('^Unnamed')]

# Identify categorical columns (object or bool types)
categorical_cols = ds.select_dtypes(include=['object', 'bool']).columns.tolist()

# Count unique categories in each categorical column
category_counts = ds[categorical_cols].nunique()

# Separate columns into low and high cardinality
low_cardinality = category_counts[category_counts <= 20].index.tolist()
high_cardinality = category_counts[category_counts > 20].index.tolist()

# One-hot encode low-cardinality categorical columns
df_encoded = pd.get_dummies(ds, columns=low_cardinality, drop_first=True)

# Frequency encode high-cardinality categorical columns
for col in high_cardinality:
    freq_encoding = ds[col].value_counts()
    df_encoded[col + '_freq'] = ds[col].map(freq_encoding)

# Drop original high-cardinality columns
df_encoded.drop(columns=high_cardinality, inplace=True)


# # Feature Selection, Prediction model and performance
# 
# **RF-Min-Max-ZScore and XGB-Min-Max-Zscore**
# *Actual vs Predicted* : 
# - Most predictions are clustered near the origin, indicating that the model performs well for lower-value properties.
# - As actual values increase, the predicted values tend to underperform, with many predictions falling below the ideal diagonal line.
# - This suggests the model may be underestimating high-value properties, possibly due to insufficient high valued property records in training data
# 
# 
# *Residual plot*: 
#  - Most residuals are centered around zero means predictions are mostly close to actual values. However, thereâs a noticeable spread, especially for higher predicted values:
#         - Some residuals are positive, meaning the model underpredicted.
#         - Some are negative, meaning the model overpredicted.
# 
# 
# **LR-Min-Max-Zscore**
# *Actual vs Predicted* : 
# - The predictions are significantly deviating from with actual values indicating that Linear Regression is not capturing the complexity of the relationships in your data, especially with skewed or non-linear patterns.
# 
# *Residual plot*: 
# - Residuals are widely scattered, especially for higher predicted values.
# - This pattern confirms that the model is not a good fit, especially for expensive properties.
# 
# 
# **Model Performance Metrics**
# 
# RÂ² (Coefficient of Determination): Higher is better (closer to 1).
# MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error): Lower is better.
# nRMSE (Normalized Root Mean Squared Error): Lower is better.
# 
# XGBoost (XGB) performs best overall, regardless of scaling method.
# Random Forest (RF) is solid but slightly less accurate than XGB.
# Linear Regression (LR) performs poorly, with low RÂ² and high error ratesâlikely underfitting the data.
# 
# 
# **Model Runtime Comparison**
# The table compares how long each model took to train and predict.
# 
# 
# Linear Regression is fastest, but its poor performance makes it unsuitable.
# XGBoost offers the best trade-off between speed and accuracy.
# Random Forest is the slowest, likely due to tree depth and ensemble size.
# 
# 
# **Model MSE Comparison**
# The table evaluates the accuracy of predictive models
# 
# XGBoost has the lowest MSE, confirming its superior predictive accuracy.
# Random Forest is close, but slightly less precise.
# Linear Regression has the highest error, reinforcing its poor fit.
# 
# 
# **Overall**
# *Best Model*: XGBoost (MinMax or ZScore)
# *Best Accuracy*: XGB (highest RÂ², lowest MAPE & nRMSE)
# *Best Efficiency*: XGB (fast runtime, low MSE)
